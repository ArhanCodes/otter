## To-do:
  - [ ] Add an autopost and allow users to configure it.
  - [ ] Instead of using Discord's CDN, build something like [this](https://otter.bruhmomentlol.repl.co/random).
  - [ ] Add more otters pictures [here](https://github.com/ArhanCodes/Otter/blob/main/src/commands/otter.ts).
  - [x] Fix the problem where the otters weren't loading in.
